https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/

1. Install Node JS https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install Gulp globally by using the following command in Terminal >> $sudo npm install gulp -g
3. Clone “swyfftdesign" repository from GitHub (https://github.com/cbuquid/swyfftdesign) onto local computer
4. Install Gulp to project folder >> $npm install gulp --save-dev
5. Install gulp-sass to project folder >> $npm install gulp-sass --save-dev
6. Run “gulp watch” on the terminal within the project, make a change to scss and note the automatic change to css/styles.css

On structure:  
Everything in the css file we don't want to edit directly.  We can edit existing .scss and if we need to, add new .scss files and @include them into the main styles.scss.
